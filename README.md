# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis 📈  

This project dives into global video game sales, uncovering trends, analysing platforms, and testing hypotheses to understand what makes a game a hit! 🚀  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- 🐼 **Pandas** – Data manipulation & analysis  
- 🔢 **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- 📈 **Plotly** – Interactive charts  
- 📏 **SciPy** – Hypothesis testing  

## 🗂 Dataset Overview  
I worked with a dataset containing sales data from different regions and game-related metrics:  

### 🎮 Game Features  
- Name  
- Platform  
- Release Year  
- Genre  
- ESRB Rating  

### 💰 Sales Metrics (in millions of USD)  
- North America (**NA_sales**)  
- Europe (**EU_sales**)  
- Japan (**JP_sales**)  
- Other Regions (**Other_sales**)  

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings  
- Critic Score (0-100)  
- User Score (0-10)  

The dataset includes **ESRB ratings**, which help determine if a game is suitable for different age groups (e.g., Teen, Mature, Everyone).  

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
🛠 **Steps taken to improve data quality:**  
✅ Standardized column names (lowercase & trimmed spaces)  
✅ Converted data to proper formats  
✅ Handled missing values with smart imputation & cleaning  
✅ Created new features for deeper insights  

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis  
I analysed trends across time, platforms, and game genres, uncovering some fascinating insights!  

### 📅 Game Releases Over the Years  
- How the number of new games fluctuated over time  

### 🎮 Platform Popularity  
- Which gaming consoles dominated the industry?  
- How long do platforms stay relevant?  

### 📦 Sales Distribution & Market Share  
- Sales trends across different platforms  
- What makes some consoles more successful than others?  

### 💬 Impact of Reviews on Sales  
- Do **high critic scores** translate to **higher sales**?

## 🌍 Regional Market Insights  
I analysed player preferences across three key gaming regions:

- 🇯🇵 **Japan:** RPGs are king! 🏯  

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing  
I tested two interesting gaming-related hypotheses:  

1. 🕹 **Do Xbox One and PC games have the same average user ratings?**  
2. 🎭 **Are Action and Sports games rated differently by players?**  

## 🚀 Key Takeaways  
📌 The **golden era** of gaming was between **2000-2010**!
